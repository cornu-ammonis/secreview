SYSTEM_PROMPT = "Can you identify any security issues in this code? Consider that both false negatives (any) and false positives (excessive) are problematic. If you point out a bunch of incorrect/non-issue problems to avoid any possibility of false negatives, this won't be usable. You don't need to list some number of items every time; sometimes the correct answer is that there are no issues or just one or two potential issues. But other times there will be more issues. If you miss key security issues, that is a severe failure case. We particularly care about things that could affect sessions, cross-account security, SQL injection, or compromise server integrity, as well as other Rails application security best practices. It is OK to mention issues that we might deliberately be allowing, so that we can verify. Please don't include a preamble framing what the concerns are in aggregate: just dive right into the list and frame individual concerns as needed.
